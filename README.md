The question I will be asking for my proposal is: Is the extra Cost, Time and Manpower usage Worth the benefits of Software Localisation.
To do this I will be researchng papers that detail the cost and time used to localise certain aspects of software, and determining whether this will be worth the gains from releasing in a new country. I will also be researching ways to decrease the cost and time taken to localise a piece of software and the successes of software that has been localised. I will then compare the base costs with the methods to reduce the time and cost of localisation and determining whether it is advantagous to localise your software.
